# Pixel Exploder
Final Project for Front End Web Development.

This is a portfolio site created from scratch in order to showcase my work.

I have made full responsive menu bar that will expand will expand vertically
while in mobile/small view. This uses a css class triggered by javascript
event listeners on the button and logo that will expand smoothly using
a css transition on the height property of the UL element of the nav.

and then switch to a horizontal navbar on medium and large.
The medium and large screen views also use media queries to change the look of the nav
and logo bars to better utilize available screen real estate.

The nav bar also features css transitions on the hover over on the link backgrounds.
This creates a smooth fade in and out on the background color and box shadow
